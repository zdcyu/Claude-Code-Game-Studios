## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

- `version`: the release version to generate notes for (e.g., `1.2.0`)
- `--style`: output style — `brief` (bullet points), `detailed` (with context), `full` (with developer commentary). Default: `detailed`.

If no version is provided, ask the user before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Gather Change Data

- Read the internal changelog at `production/releases/[version]/changelog.md` if it exists
- Run `git log` between the previous release tag and current tag/HEAD
- Read sprint retrospectives in `production/sprints/` for context
- Read any balance change documents in `design/balance/`
- Read bug fix records from QA if available

---

## Phase 3: Categorize and Translate

Categorize all changes into player-facing categories:

- **New Content**: new features, maps, characters, items, modes
- **Gameplay Changes**: balance adjustments, mechanic changes, progression changes
- **Quality of Life**: UI improvements, convenience features, accessibility
- **Bug Fixes**: grouped by system (combat, UI, networking, etc.)
- **Performance**: optimization improvements players might notice
- **Known Issues**: transparency about unresolved problems

Translate developer language to player language:

- "Refactored damage calculation pipeline" → "Improved hit detection accuracy"
- "Fixed null reference in inventory manager" → "Fixed a crash when opening inventory"
- "Reduced GC allocations in combat loop" → "Improved combat performance"
- Remove purely internal changes that don't affect players
- Preserve specific numbers for balance changes (damage: 50 → 45)

## Phase 4: Generate Patch Notes

### Brief Style
```markdown
# Patch [Version] — [Title]

**New**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

**Changes**
- [Balance/mechanic change with before → after values]

**Fixes**
- [Bug fix 1]
- [Bug fix 2]

**Known Issues**
- [Issue 1]
```

### Detailed Style
```markdown
# Patch [Version] — [Title]
*[Date]*

## Highlights
[1-2 sentence summary of the most exciting changes]

## New Content
### [Feature Name]
[2-3 sentences describing the feature and why players should be excited]

## Gameplay Changes
### Balance
| Change | Before | After | Reason |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Item/ability] | [old value] | [new value] | [brief rationale] |

### Mechanics
- **[Change]**: [explanation of what changed and why]

## Quality of Life
- [Improvement with context]

## Bug Fixes
### Combat
- Fixed [description of what players experienced]

### UI
- Fixed [description]

### Networking
- Fixed [description]

## Performance
- [Improvement players will notice]

## Known Issues
- [Issue and workaround if available]
```

### Full Style
Includes everything from Detailed, plus:
```markdown
## Developer Commentary
### [Topic]
> [Developer insight into a major change — why it was made, what was considered,
> what the team learned. Written in first-person team voice.]
```

---

## Phase 5: Review Output

Check the generated notes for:

- No internal jargon (replace technical terms with player-friendly language)
- No references to internal systems, tickets, or sprint numbers
- Balance changes include before/after values
- Bug fixes describe the player experience, not the technical cause
- Tone matches the game's voice (adjust formality based on game style)

---

## Phase 6: Save Patch Notes

Present the completed patch notes to the user along with: a count of changes by category, and any internal changes that were excluded (for review).

Ask: "May I write this to `production/releases/[version]/patch-notes.md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

---

## Phase 7: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — patch notes generated and saved.

- Run `/release-checklist` to verify all other release gates are met before publishing.
- Share the patch notes draft with the community-manager for tone review before posting publicly.
