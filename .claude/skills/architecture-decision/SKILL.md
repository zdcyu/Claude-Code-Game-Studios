When this skill is invoked:

## 0. Parse Arguments — Detect Retrofit Mode

**If the argument starts with `retrofit` followed by a file path**
(e.g., `/architecture-decision retrofit docs/architecture/adr-0001-event-system.md`):

Enter **retrofit mode**:

1. Read the existing ADR file completely.
2. Identify which template sections are present by scanning headings:
   - `## Status` — **BLOCKING if missing**: `/story-readiness` cannot check ADR acceptance
   - `## ADR Dependencies` — HIGH if missing: dependency ordering breaks
   - `## Engine Compatibility` — HIGH if missing: post-cutoff risk unknown
   - `## GDD Requirements Addressed` — MEDIUM if missing: traceability lost
3. Present to the user:
   ```
   ## Retrofit: [ADR title]
   File: [path]

   Sections already present (will not be touched):
   ✓ Status: [current value, or "MISSING — will add"]
   ✓ [section]

   Missing sections to add:
   ✗ Status — BLOCKING (stories cannot validate ADR acceptance without this)
   ✗ ADR Dependencies — HIGH
   ✗ Engine Compatibility — HIGH
   ```
4. Ask: "Shall I add the [N] missing sections? I will not modify any existing content."
5. If yes:
   - For **Status**: ask the user — "What is the current status of this decision?"
     Options: "Proposed", "Accepted", "Deprecated", "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
   - For **ADR Dependencies**: ask — "Does this decision depend on any other ADR?
     Does it enable or block any other ADR or epic?" Accept "None" for each field.
   - For **Engine Compatibility**: read the engine reference docs (same as Step 0 below)
     and ask the user to confirm the domain. Then generate the table with verified data.
   - For **GDD Requirements Addressed**: ask — "Which GDD systems motivated this decision?
     What specific requirement in each GDD does this ADR address?"
   - Append each missing section to the ADR file using the Edit tool.
   - **Never modify any existing section.** Only append or fill absent sections.
6. After adding all missing sections, update the ADR's `## Date` field if it is absent.
7. Suggest: "Run `/architecture-review` to re-validate coverage now that this ADR
   has its Status and Dependencies fields."

If NOT in retrofit mode, proceed to Step 0 below (normal ADR authoring).

**No-argument guard**: If no argument was provided (title is empty), ask before
running Phase 0:

> "What technical decision are you documenting? Please provide a short title
> (e.g., `event-system-architecture`, `physics-engine-choice`)."

Use the user's response as the title, then proceed to Step 0.

---

## 0. Load Engine Context (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before doing anything else, establish the engine environment:

1. Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md` to get:
   - Engine name and version
   - LLM knowledge cutoff date
   - Post-cutoff version risk levels (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

2. Identify the **domain** of this architecture decision from the title or
   user description. Common domains: Physics, Rendering, UI, Audio, Navigation,
   Animation, Networking, Core, Input, Scripting.

3. Read the corresponding module reference if it exists:
   `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/modules/[domain].md`

4. Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/breaking-changes.md` — flag any
   changes in the relevant domain that post-date the LLM's training cutoff.

5. Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md` — flag any APIs
   in the relevant domain that should not be used.

6. **Display a knowledge gap warning** before proceeding if the domain carries
   MEDIUM or HIGH risk:

   ```
   ⚠️  ENGINE KNOWLEDGE GAP WARNING
   Engine: [name + version]
   Domain: [domain]
   Risk Level: HIGH — This version is post-LLM-cutoff.

   Key changes verified from engine-reference docs:
   - [Change 1 relevant to this domain]
   - [Change 2]

   This ADR will be cross-referenced against the engine reference library.
   Proceed with verified information only — do NOT rely solely on training data.
   ```

   If no engine has been configured yet, prompt: "No engine is configured.
   Run `/setup-engine` first, or tell me which engine you are using."

## 1. Determine the next ADR number

Scan `docs/architecture/` for existing ADRs to find the next number.

---

## 2. Gather context

Read related code, existing ADRs, and relevant GDDs from `design/gdd/`.

### 2a: Architecture Registry Check (BLOCKING gate)

Read `docs/registry/architecture.yaml`. Extract entries relevant to this ADR's
domain and decision (grep by system name, domain keyword, or state being touched).

Present any relevant stances to the user **before** the collaborative design
begins, as locked constraints:

```
## Existing Architectural Stances (must not contradict)

State Ownership:
  player_health → owned by health-system (ADR-0001)
  Interface: HealthComponent.current_health (read-only float)
  → If this ADR reads or writes player health, it must use this interface.

Interface Contracts:
  damage_delivery → signal pattern (ADR-0003)
  Signal: damage_dealt(amount, target, is_crit)
  → If this ADR delivers or receives damage events, it must use this signal.

Forbidden Patterns:
  ✗ autoload_singleton_coupling (ADR-0001)
  ✗ direct_cross_system_state_write (ADR-0000)
  → The proposed approach must not use these patterns.
```

If the user's proposed decision would contradict any registered stance, surface
the conflict immediately:

> "⚠️ Conflict: This ADR proposes [X], but ADR-[NNNN] established that [Y] is
> the accepted pattern for this purpose. Proceeding without resolving this will
> produce contradictory ADRs and inconsistent stories.
> Options: (1) Align with the existing stance, (2) Supersede ADR-[NNNN] with
> an explicit replacement, (3) Explain why this case is an exception."

Do not proceed to Step 3 (collaborative design) until any conflict is resolved
or explicitly accepted as an intentional exception.

---

## 3. Guide the decision collaboratively

Ask clarifying questions if the title alone is not sufficient. For each major
section, present 2-4 options with pros/cons before drafting. Do not generate
the ADR until the key decision is confirmed by the user.

Key questions to ask:
- What problem are we solving? What breaks if we don't decide this now?
- What constraints apply (engine version, platform, performance budget)?
- What alternatives have you already considered?
- Which post-cutoff engine features (if any) does this decision depend on?
- **Which GDD systems motivated this decision?** For each, what specific
  requirement (rule, formula, performance constraint, integration point) in
  that GDD cannot be satisfied without this architectural decision?

If the decision is foundational (no GDD drives it directly), ask:
- Which GDD systems will this decision constrain or enable?

This GDD linkage becomes a mandatory "GDD Requirements Addressed" section
in the ADR. Do not skip it.

**Does this ADR have ordering constraints?** Ask:
- Does this decision depend on any other ADR that isn't yet Accepted? (If
  so, this ADR cannot be safely implemented until that one is resolved.)
- Does accepting this ADR unlock or unblock any other pending decisions?
- Does this ADR block any specific epic or story from starting?

Record the answers in the **ADR Dependencies** section. If no ordering
constraints exist, write "None" in each field.

## 4. Generate the ADR

Following this format:

```markdown
# ADR-[NNNN]: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Date
[Date of decision]

## Engine Compatibility

| **References Consulted** | [List engine-reference docs read, e.g. `docs/engine-reference/godot/modules/physics.md`] |
| **Post-Cutoff APIs Used** | [Any APIs from post-LLM-cutoff versions this decision depends on, or "None"] |
| **Verification Required** | [Specific behaviours to test before shipping, or "None"] |

## ADR Dependencies

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Depends On** | [ADR-NNNN (must be Accepted before this can be implemented), or "None"] |
| **Enables** | [ADR-NNNN (this ADR unlocks that decision), or "None"] |

4.5. **Engine Specialist Validation** — Before saving, spawn the **primary engine specialist** via Task to validate the drafted ADR:
   - Read `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` `Engine Specialists` section to get the primary specialist
   - If no engine is configured (`[TO BE CONFIGURED]`), skip this step
   - Spawn `subagent_type: [primary specialist]` with: the ADR's Engine Compatibility section, Decision section, Key Interfaces, and the engine reference docs path. Ask them to:
     1. Confirm the proposed approach is idiomatic for the pinned engine version
     2. Flag any APIs or patterns that are deprecated or changed post-training-cutoff
     3. Identify engine-specific risks or gotchas not captured in the current ADR draft
   - If the specialist identifies a **blocking issue** (wrong API, deprecated approach, engine version incompatibility): revise the Decision and Engine Compatibility sections accordingly, then confirm the changes with the user before proceeding
   - If the specialist finds **minor notes** only: incorporate them into the ADR's Risks subsection

5. Ask: "May I write this ADR to `docs/architecture/adr-[NNNN]-[slug].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

6. **Update Architecture Registry**

Scan the written ADR for new architectural stances that should be registered:
- State it claims ownership of
- Interface contracts it defines (signal signatures, method APIs)
- Performance budget it claims
- API choices it makes explicitly
- Patterns it bans (Consequences → Negative or explicit "do not use X")

Present candidates:
```
Registry candidates from this ADR:
  NEW state ownership:      player_stamina → stamina-system
  NEW interface contract:   stamina_depleted signal
  NEW performance budget:   stamina-system: 0.5ms/frame
  NEW forbidden pattern:    polling stamina each frame (use signal instead)
  EXISTING (referenced_by update only): player_health → already registered ✅
```

Ask: "May I update `docs/registry/architecture.yaml` with these [N] new stances?"

If yes: append new entries. Never modify existing entries — if a stance is
changing, set the old entry to `status: superseded_by: ADR-[NNNN]` and add
the new entry.

**Next Steps:** Run `/architecture-review` to validate coverage after the ADR is saved. Update any stories that were `Status: Blocked` pending this ADR to `Status: Ready`.
