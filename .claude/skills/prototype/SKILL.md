## Phase 1: Define the Question

Read the concept description from the argument. Identify the core question this prototype must answer. If the concept is vague, state the question explicitly before proceeding — a prototype without a clear question wastes time.

---

## Phase 2: Load Project Context

Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context and the current tech stack. Understand what engine, language, and frameworks are in use so the prototype is built with compatible tooling.

---

## Phase 3: Plan the Prototype

Define in 3-5 bullet points what the minimum viable prototype looks like:

- What is the core question?
- What is the absolute minimum code needed to answer it?
- What can be skipped (error handling, polish, architecture)?

Present this plan to the user before building. Ask for confirmation if scope seems unclear.

---

## Phase 4: Implement

Ask: "May I create the prototype directory at `prototypes/[concept-name]/` and begin implementation?"

If yes, create the directory. Every file must begin with:

```
// PROTOTYPE - NOT FOR PRODUCTION
// Question: [Core question being tested]
// Date: [Current date]
```

Standards are intentionally relaxed:

- Hardcode values freely
- Use placeholder assets
- Skip error handling
- Use the simplest approach that works
- Copy code rather than importing from production

Run the prototype. Observe behavior. Collect any measurable data (frame times, interaction counts, feel assessments).

---

## Phase 5: Generate Prototype Report

Draft the report:

```markdown
## Prototype Report: [Concept Name]

### Hypothesis
[What we expected to be true -- the question we set out to answer]

### Approach
[What we built, how long it took, what shortcuts we took]

### Result
[What actually happened -- specific observations, not opinions]

### Metrics
[Any measurable data collected during testing]
- Frame time: [if relevant]
- Feel assessment: [subjective but specific -- "response felt sluggish at
  200ms delay" not "felt bad"]
- Player action counts: [if relevant]
- Iteration count: [how many attempts to get it working]

### Recommendation: [PROCEED / PIVOT / KILL]

[One paragraph explaining the recommendation with evidence]

### If Proceeding
[What needs to change for a production-quality implementation]
- Architecture requirements
- Performance targets
- Scope adjustments from the original design
- Estimated production effort

### If Pivoting
[What alternative direction the results suggest]

### If Killing
[Why this concept does not work and what we should do instead]

### Lessons Learned
[Discoveries that affect other systems or future work]
```

Ask: "May I write this report to `prototypes/[concept-name]/REPORT.md`?"

If yes, write the file.

---

## Phase 6: Creative Director Review

Delegate the decision to the creative-director. Spawn a `creative-director` subagent via Task and provide:

- The full REPORT.md content
- The original design question
- Any game pillars or concept doc from `design/gdd/` that are relevant

Ask the creative-director to:

- Evaluate the prototype result against the game's creative vision and pillars
- Confirm, modify, or override the prototyper's PROCEED / PIVOT / KILL recommendation
- If PROCEED: identify any creative constraints for the production implementation
- If PIVOT: specify which direction aligns better with the pillars
- If KILL: note whether the underlying player need should be addressed differently

The creative-director's decision is final. Update the REPORT.md `Recommendation` section with the creative-director's verdict if it differs from the prototyper's.

---

## Phase 7: Summary and Next Steps

Output a summary to the user: the core question, the result, the prototyper's initial recommendation, and the creative-director's final decision. Link to the full report at `prototypes/[concept-name]/REPORT.md`.

If **PROCEED**: run `/design-system` to begin the production GDD for this mechanic, or `/architecture-decision` to record key technical decisions before implementation.

If **PIVOT** or **KILL**: no further action needed — the prototype report is the deliverable.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — prototype finished. Recommendation is PROCEED, PIVOT, or KILL based on findings above.

### Important Constraints

- Prototype code must NEVER import from production source files
- Production code must NEVER import from prototype directories
- If the recommendation is PROCEED, the production implementation must be written from scratch — prototype code is not refactored into production
- Total prototype effort should be timeboxed to 1-3 days equivalent of work
- If the prototype scope starts growing, stop and reassess whether the question can be simplified
